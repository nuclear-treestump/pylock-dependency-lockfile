# Frequently Asked Questions

## How does PyLock Dependency Manager differ from `requirements.txt`?

While `requirements.txt` and a lockfile generated by PyLock both serve to specify the dependencies required by a Python project, there are some key differences:

1. **Version Pinning:** `requirements.txt` may not specify the exact versions of packages, which could lead to issues if a future version of a package breaks compatibility with your code. PyLock's lockfile specifies the exact version of each dependency that your script was tested with, ensuring consistency.

2. **Transitive Dependencies:** `requirements.txt` typically only lists the top-level dependencies that your code imports directly. PyLock's lockfile lists not only the direct dependencies of your script, but also their dependencies, providing a full snapshot of your script's dependency tree.

3. **Dependency Checking Before Execution:** PyLock checks each dependency before the script is executed, and if any are missing or have the wrong version, it alerts you and prevents the script from running.

4. **Metadata:** PyLock's lockfile includes metadata for each package, such as its author, home page, and summary.

## What's the current status of PyLock Dependency Manager?

As of now, PyLock Dependency Manager can generate a lockfile that lists all the dependencies of a Python script along with their metadata, and can check the availability and versions of these dependencies before running the script. 

## What's the roadmap for PyLock Dependency Manager?

Future plans include:

1. Adding functionality to spin up a virtual environment on the fly with the dependencies required in the version required for the script run.
2. Integrations with VSCode and CI/CD pipelines.
3. Dependency scanning via services like deps.dev.

Please note that these are subject to change and will be implemented at the developer's discretion.

## How can I request a feature?

You can submit a feature request, but please note that whether it gets implemented is ultimately at the discretion of the developer.

## Can the name change?

Yes, the name "PyLock Dependency Manager" is temporary and could change in the future if the need arises.
