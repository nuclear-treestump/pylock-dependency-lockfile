## Data Collection and Usage

PyLock Dependency Manager does not collect or store any personal data. The tool operates entirely locally and does not communicate with any external servers for the purpose of data collection or analytics. All information regarding your dependencies is stored locally on your machine and is not shared or transmitted.

## Security

If future versions of PyLock Dependency Manager include functionality for tracking dependencies across multiple scripts using a database, users will be responsible for the security of this database. The tool will not provide any mechanisms for remote access to this data or any other form of data sharing.
