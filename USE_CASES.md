# PyLock Dependency Manager - Use Cases

## 1. Single Script Dependency Management

If you're working with a single Python script and want to ensure that your environment has the correct dependencies and versions installed, PyLock can help. It will check your script's imports, generate a lockfile listing the dependencies, and verify that the correct versions are installed in your environment.

## 2. Multi-Script Dependency Management

For larger projects involving multiple scripts, each potentially having its own set of dependencies, PyLock can significantly simplify your dependency management. Run PyLock for each script and it will ensure your environment is correctly set up for each one, preventing issues caused by incorrect or missing dependencies.

## 3. Automated Dependency Checks

If you're developing an application that needs to automatically check or manage dependencies as part of its operation, you can use PyLock directly within your Python code. This allows for programmatic management of dependencies and can be particularly useful in CI/CD pipelines or other automated workflows.

## 4. Version-Specific Virtual Environment Setup

In future updates, PyLock will be able to automatically create a version-specific virtual environment for your scripts. This will allow for isolated environments with exactly the right dependencies, preventing conflicts between different projects or scripts.

## 5. Dependency Tracking and Security Checks

With planned integration with dependency tracking services like deps.dev, PyLock will be able to provide information on the security and licensing of your dependencies, helping you keep your projects safe and compliant.
